        set1: [
            {q:"You receive a WhatsApp message from a profile named 'HDFC Bank Support' at 2:47 AM. It claims your account is suspended due to suspicious activity and provides a link to 'verify your identity' within 30 minutes to avoid a permanent block. What do you do?",o:["Click link","Call number","Check official app","Share OTP"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Banks never use WhatsApp for urgent links.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Urgent links steal credentials.",why_correct:"Official banking apps are the only secure channel. A bank will never communicate through unofficial chat apps for critical account issues.",why_wrong:"Scammers use late-night messages and extreme urgency to panic you into clicking. Once you click, your login data is captured instantly by their fake page."},
            {q:"You get a video call from someone in a police uniform claiming to be from the Cyber Cell. They say your Aadhaar is linked to a ₹50 Crore money laundering case and you are under 'Digital Arrest.' They demand ₹3 Lakh as 'refundable bail' via UPI to clear your name immediately. Your response?",o:["Pay now","Visit local station","Send KYC","Click portal"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Real police never arrest via video call.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Digital Arrest is a total fabrication.",why_correct:"Law enforcement agencies always require physical presence at a station for legal matters. They never settle criminal investigations or bail through UPI transfers.",why_wrong:"This is a 'Digital Arrest' scam. Fraudsters wear fake uniforms and use high-pressure fear tactics to keep you on a video call until you transfer all your savings."},
            {q:"An SMS arrives stating your 'PhonePe refund of ₹4,999 has failed.' It instructs you to 'Reply YES' to this message so the system can automatically retry the refund process directly to your linked bank account. How do you react?",o:["Reply YES","Check in-app","Share PIN","Call sender"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Refunds never require an SMS reply.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: YES replies confirm you are a live target.",why_correct:"Payment apps process refunds automatically back to the original source. You should only check your status within the official, secured app interface.",why_wrong:"Replying 'YES' to a random number confirms your phone is active and vulnerable. It can also be used as authorization for fraudulent charges on your mobile bill."},
            {q:"You find an investment platform called 'Quantum Wealth' promising 5% DAILY returns on your capital. They claim their AI-trading bot is 'guaranteed' to never lose money, and they show screenshots of users turning ₹10,000 into ₹50,000 in just 10 days. Should you invest?",o:["Invest small","It's a Ponzi","Ask friends","Try ₹5K"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: No legit business can guarantee 5% daily.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: High guaranteed returns are classic traps.",why_correct:"If a business could generate 5% daily, they wouldn't need your ₹10K. This is a Ponzi scheme where early investors are paid using the money of new members.",why_wrong:"The 'Too Good To Be True' rule is your best defense. They often show fake profit dashboards to lure you into 'investing' life-changing amounts before they disappear."},
            {q:"Your phone rings and you hear your 'Cousin' crying hysterically. They claim they are stuck at the airport, their wallet was stolen, and they need ₹25,000 via UPI immediately to buy a last-minute flight home before the gates close in 10 minutes. What is the safest action?",o:["Send money","Verify contact","Ask details","Call airport"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: AI voice clones can mimic anyone perfectly.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Never send money based on a voice alone.",why_correct:"Always hang up and call the person back on their known, saved phone number. Using a pre-set 'secret code' with family for emergencies is also a great safety measure.",why_wrong:"AI voice cloning technology can now replicate a person's voice using just a 3-second sample from social media. Scammers use this 'emergency' to stop you from thinking clearly."},
            {q:"A delivery agent arrives with a parcel you didn't order. He says there is a 'system error' and he can't complete the return unless you provide the 6-digit OTP that was just sent to your phone. He seems very helpful and in a hurry. Do you give it?",o:["Share OTP","Check app/Wait","Give old OTP","Call office"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: You never need an OTP to RECEIVE a parcel.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: OTPs are for logins, not delivery proof.",why_correct:"OTPs are generally used to verify identity for payments or logins. A delivery agent only needs you to sign or provide a 'delivery code' provided inside the official app.",why_wrong:"By asking for an OTP, the scammer is likely trying to reset your Amazon, Flipkart, or bank password in the background. Giving it grants them full account access."},
            {q:"You join a Telegram channel called 'IPL Fixed Matches VIP.' The admin posts daily screenshots of winning bets and offers a '100% Guaranteed Winner' for tonight's match if you pay a ₹500 membership fee via UPI. What's the truth here?",o:["Join VIP","Report/Block","Try once","Ask proof"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Match fixing info is not sold on Telegram.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: These channels are purely for stealing fees.",why_correct:"These channels use edited screenshots and 'deleted' losing posts to make it look like they are always right. Real match-fixing is illegal and would never be sold for ₹500.",why_wrong:"Once you pay the fee, they will either block you immediately or ask for a 'commission' on the fake winnings they claim you will get. You will never see your money again."},
            {q:"You receive an urgent SMS from 'IRCTC' stating your upcoming train PNR has been cancelled due to a technical glitch. It provides a link: 'irctc-rebook-now.co.in' to rebook your seat immediately at no extra cost before the quota fills up. What do you do?",o:["Click link","Check official site","Call SMS","Reply HELP"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: IRCTC never sends clickable links via SMS.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Fake URLs steal your bank data.",why_correct:"Manual login on the official irctc.co.in website is the only way to manage bookings. Check the URL carefully—scammers use slight typos to trick you.",why_wrong:"Fake domains look nearly identical to the real ones but are designed to capture your IRCTC credentials and bank details when you try to 'pay' for the new ticket."},
            {q:"A verified celebrity with millions of followers DMs you on Instagram. They claim to be running a promotion and will pay you ₹1 Lakh if you spend 5 minutes reviewing a new app they've developed. They send you a link to download the 'Beta' file. How do you respond?",o:["Do review","Block/Scam","Send email","Ask for ID"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Celebs don't DM random people for jobs.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Celeb accounts are often compromised.",why_correct:"Official celebrity promotions are handled through agencies and legal contracts. They would never reach out to a random follower via DM to offer high-paying tasks.",why_wrong:"Scammers often hack verified accounts to gain instant trust. They will ask you to download a 'review file' that is actually malware, or ask for a 'processing fee' to get paid."},
            {q:"An SMS warns you that your Aadhaar is not linked to your bank account and it will be frozen within 24 hours per government mandate. It includes a link to a 'Self-Service Portal' where you can enter your Aadhaar and Bank details to fix it. Your move?",o:["Urgent - click","UIDAI doesn't link","Use bank app","Ignore"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Use your bank's official app only.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: UIDAI never sends clickable links for banks.",why_correct:"Banking apps provide a secure, encrypted tunnel for KYC updates. If an update is actually required, the bank will notify you through their official app or mail.",why_wrong:"Aadhaar phishing is used to collect your identity details and biometric info. Clicking the link and entering your details allows scammers to open fake accounts in your name."},
        ],
        set2: [
            {q:"You are selling a sofa on OLX. A potential buyer messages saying they are 'very interested' and will pay the full amount as an advance. They send a QR code and tell you: 'Just scan this and enter your PIN to receive the money in your account.' Do you scan?",o:["Scan to get","QR pays only","Ask bank","Check QR"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Scanning a QR always DEDUCTS money.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: QR codes never 'receive' money.",why_correct:"According to RBI rules, you never need to enter your PIN or scan a QR code to receive money. If someone asks you to 'scan to receive', they are lying to you.",why_wrong:"The scammer hopes you believe that the QR code is a way to verify your account. The moment you scan and enter your PIN, the money is pulled FROM your account immediately."},
            {q:"You see a sponsored Facebook Ad: 'Work from home! Earn ₹5,000 per day simply by liking YouTube videos and submitting screenshots. No experience required, open to all.' It sounds like the perfect side hustle. Should you apply?",o:["Start today","Task Scam","Apply now","Pay fee"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: High pay for low work is a 'Task Scam'.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: These lead to 'investment' traps.",why_correct:"No legitimate company pays massive amounts for a simple 'like'. This is a psychological trap designed to make you feel like you've found an easy income stream.",why_wrong:"These scams start by paying you ₹100 to build trust. Later, they force you to 'invest' your own money to unlock bigger tasks, then they block you and steal the deposit."},
            {q:"An SMS from a 10-digit mobile number claims: 'Dear Customer, your electricity power will be disconnected at 9:00 PM tonight because your previous month's bill update is pending. Please call our officer at 9876543210 immediately.' What is your action?",o:["Call now","Pay link","Check official app","Call 100"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Official boards never use private numbers.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Calling leads to a remote access trap.",why_correct:"Use only official DISCOM portals or BBPS apps like GPay/PhonePe to check your bill status. Electricity boards never threaten instant disconnection via SMS.",why_wrong:"If you call that number, they will trick you into downloading a screen-sharing app like AnyDesk. Once installed, they can see your banking PIN as you type it."},
            {q:"You receive a message: 'Your YONO SBI KYC has expired. Your account will be blocked by tomorrow. Please click here to login and update your documents: sbi-kyc-verify.com.' It looks like the real SBI login page. Do you use the link?",o:["Click link","Visit SBI","Send SMS","Share ID"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Banks never put login links in SMS.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Phishing links capture your credentials.",why_correct:"Banks send informative messages, but they will never provide a direct link to a login page. Always type the bank URL manually in your browser or use the official app.",why_wrong:"The link leads to a 'mirror' website that looks 100% like the real SBI page. When you enter your username and OTP, the scammer uses them to drain your account in seconds."},
            {q:"You can't find your Swiggy order and search for 'Swiggy Customer Care' on Google. The first result is a mobile number. You call it, and the 'agent' says you need to download a 'Refund Tracking App' to get your money back. What do you do?",o:["Install it","Safe fix","Scam - block","Share order"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Google search 'customer care' is often fake.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Refund apps are actually remote-control apps.",why_correct:"Scammers pay for Google Ads to appear at the top of search results with fake help numbers. Only use the support chat found inside the official Swiggy or Zomato app.",why_wrong:"A 'Refund App' is just a trick to get you to install a remote desktop tool. This gives the criminal total control over your phone, including access to your SMS for OTPs."},
            {q:"A pop-up on a website says: 'Congratulations! You are the 1,000,000th visitor and have won a free iPhone 15 Pro. To claim your prize, simply pay a small ₹499 processing and shipping fee.' It asks for your credit card details. Is this legitimate?",o:["Pay shipping","Great deal","It's a trap","Ask COD"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: They want your card CVV, not ₹499.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: 'Free' items that cost money are scams.",why_correct:"No stranger is giving away a ₹1 Lakh phone for a ₹500 shipping fee. This is a classic 'Carding' bait used to steal your credit card details for massive online purchases.",why_wrong:"The 'Payment Page' is a fake site. Even if you only pay ₹499, they now have your card number, expiry, and CVV, allowing them to make unauthorized transactions later."},
            {q:"A 'Technical Support' agent calls saying your computer is sending out virus alerts. He asks you to download 'AnyDesk' or 'TeamViewer' so he can remotely log in and fix the issue for free as a courtesy. Should you allow this?",o:["Fix it","Only for banks","Scam - block","Share ID"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: AnyDesk gives them full phone control.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: They can see your OTPs live.",why_correct:"Screen-sharing apps are for technical support with people you know and trust. Sharing your screen with a stranger is like giving them the keys to your entire digital life.",why_wrong:"Once connected, the scammer will ask you to open your bank app to 'verify' something. They will record your PIN and see every OTP that arrives via SMS to steal your funds."},
            {q:"While waiting at the airport, you see a 'Free High-Speed Public Wi-Fi' network. You decide to use it to transfer ₹50,000 to your landlord since your bill is due today. Is it safe to perform this transaction on a public network?",o:["Yes, it's fast","Use VPN","Unsafe/Avoid","Safe for apps"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Public Wi-Fi is easy to intercept.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Hackers use 'Sniffing' on public networks.",why_correct:"Public networks are often unencrypted and can be cloned by hackers nearby. Always use your mobile data or a trusted VPN for any financial transactions while traveling.",why_wrong:"A 'Man-in-the-Middle' attack allows a hacker on the same Wi-Fi to 'see' the data traveling between your phone and the bank server, potentially stealing your login tokens."},
            {q:"You get a WhatsApp message with an audio clip of Amitabh Bachchan's voice. It says you've won a ₹25 Lakh KBC Lottery and must call 'Manager Rana Pratap Singh' on a provided WhatsApp number to claim it. How should you handle this?",o:["Call now","Send tax","Block Scam","Ask proof"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: KBC never calls on WhatsApp.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: You can't win a lottery you didn't enter.",why_correct:"Legitimate lotteries and game shows don't use WhatsApp voice notes or random profile pictures of celebrities. This is a targeted scam to exploit your hope for easy money.",why_wrong:"If you call, they will demand a 'File Charge' or 'GST' to release the winnings. Once you pay the first small fee, they will keep inventing new reasons for you to send more money."},
            {q:"Suddenly, your phone loses all network signal in a busy city area. An hour later, you check your email on a computer and see three bank alerts for ₹1 Lakh each. Your signal is still dead. What has likely happened to you?",o:["Network bug","Sim Swap","Bank error","Phone hack"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: They cloned your SIM to get OTPs.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: A dead signal + bank SMS is a Sim Swap.",why_correct:"This is a SIM Swap fraud. Scammers trick the operator into deactivating your SIM and issuing a new one to them, giving them control over all your incoming SMS OTPs.",why_wrong:"If your phone suddenly loses network in a high-signal area, immediately contact your service provider from another phone to check if a new SIM has been issued illegally."},

        set3: [
            {q:"A person you met on a matrimonial site for 2 weeks says they've sent you an expensive diamond set from the UK as a surprise. Later, 'Customs' calls saying the gift is stuck and you must pay a ₹50,000 'Clearance Fee' via UPI to a private name. Do you pay?",o:["Pay fee","Ask receipt","Romance Scam","Call DHL"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Scammers build fake relationships to steal cash.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: Customs doesn't collect cash via UPI.",why_correct:"This is a 'Romance Scam'. Fraudsters build trust over weeks then invent an emergency. Real customs officers never call individuals to ask for UPI payments to private accounts.",why_wrong:"The 'gift' is entirely imaginary. Once you pay the 'customs fee', the scammer will claim there is a 'laundering fine' to steal even more money before disappearing forever."},
            {q:"An online 'job' pays you ₹150 for liking 3 Google Maps places. After you get the money, they add you to a group and say: 'To unlock VIP tasks that pay ₹5,000 per day, you must first deposit a ₹5,000 security fee.' Should you proceed?",o:["Invest now","Ponzi Scam","Ask task","Try ₹1K"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Payouts are small bait for a large trap.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: You will never get the deposit back.",why_correct:"Small early payments are used to lower your guard. Legitimate freelance work never requires you to pay a 'membership fee' or 'deposit' to receive your earned salary.",why_wrong:"The moment you deposit the ₹5000, the scammers will show a fake balance on their website. However, they will block your withdrawal until you 'invest' even more money."},
            {q:"You get a WhatsApp message from 'Income Tax Dept' with a file named 'Income_Tax_Refund_Form_2024.apk'. It says you are eligible for a ₹15,000 refund and must install this app to verify your bank account. Do you open it?",o:["Open PDF","It's Malware","Safe file","Check size"],c:1,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: .apk files are Android apps, not documents.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: This app steals your SMS/Bank data.",why_correct:"The government never sends apps to citizens via WhatsApp. Files ending in .apk are applications that can execute code, spy on your camera, and read your SMS messages.",why_wrong:"Opening this file installs a 'Trojan' on your phone. It runs silently in the background, intercepting your banking OTPs and sending them to the hacker's remote server."},

He asks you to 'Screen Share' your desktop using a tool he provides so he can 'manually activate' it for you.

They have internal tools to check account status without needing your view.",why_wrong:"Even if the bug is real, sharing your screen allows the 'agent' to see you type your passwords and see the contents of your private messages and gallery."},

Your response?",o:["Pay & get","Call agent","Scam - ignore","Check site"],c:2,e_correct:"✅ CORRECT: Insurance bonuses are never paid for in advance.",e_wrong:"❌ WRONG: LIC never uses UPI for fee collections.",why_correct:"Policy bonuses are automatically added to your account or paid through official bank transfers. Legitimate insurance companies never ask for a 'fee' to release your own money.",why_wrong:"Fraudsters use your leaked policy data to sound convincing. They often pose as senior IRDAI officials to pressure you into paying 'processing fees' that don't exist."},
